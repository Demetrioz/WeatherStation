# WeatherStation

WeatherStation is a Raspberry Pi Pico powered weatherstation that runs on solar power
and connects to a wireless network. While connected to the network, it will
periodically send messages to a message broker, which can then be handled and
saved to a database.

## Dependencies

WeatherStation uses the following external libraries:

- [Adafruit Blinka]()
- [Adafruit BME 280]()
- [Adafruit Bus Device]()
- [Adafruit Platform Detect]()
- [Adafruit Register]()

Due to space requirements, un-needed files from the above libraries were deleted.
